# MWENCLUBHOUSE-SDK
This sdk is developed seperately from the actual application running on the server. This allows me to easily test the program through a program like Docker / GitLab. In other words, instead of running the application, then testing random API keys or parameters through GET, PUT, POST commands, I can run my test cases to test the methods directly.

As a result, I can code with "confidence" when using it inside mwenclubhouse-gateway.

## Reason Abandoned

---------------------------
|Directory| Reason|
|-----| ---- |
|todoplanner| Todoist added Boards. I've been using it since freshman year, and even though I do look for other options, none make me as productive as Todoist. The Boards was the last thing I needed for the ideal ToDoPlanner. It would be better to create wrappers around Todoist to better enhance my productivity.
