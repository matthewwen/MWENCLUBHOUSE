# CI/CD Tools Currently Active
CI/CD is currently being developed for the mwenclubhouse. CI/CD is important because it tests my my code before being intergraded to other projects/repos.
The mwenclubhouse uses gitlab ci cd tools, and it tests the code automatically. Here are the content inside .gitlab ci cd tools. Most are in a work of progress.
